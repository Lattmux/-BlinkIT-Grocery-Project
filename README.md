This project focuses on analyzing BlinkIT grocery sales data using Microsoft Excel. 
The goal is to transform raw data into meaningful insights through data cleaning, pivot tables, charts, and an interactive dashboard, in order to support decision-making in retail operations.


## Project Objectives
Objective
Evaluate performance of total sales across different items and outlets
Identify Top 5 higest_selling item types.
Analyze outlet sales by size, location, and type
Identify yearly rating trend with 2018 being the highest.
Create an Excel dashboard that is clean, interactive, and business-friendly


## Key Metrics (KPIs)
| KPI                        | Meaning                                        |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Total Sales**            | Overall revenue generated across all outlets.  |
| **Total Rating**           | Total product rating from customers            |

| **Outlet Sales Breakdown** | Sales comparison across outlet types and sizes |
| **Category-Wise Sales**    | Top and bottom item categories by revenue      |

## Key Insights from the Analysis

Top Categories	Snacks food, Fruits & Vegetables, and Household were the highest-selling categories
Outlet Type	Supermarket Type 1 had the strongest sales performance
Outlet Size	Medium-sized outlets performed better than small or large outlets
Product Visibility	Products with higher visibility (shelf placement) sold more
Ratings	Higher-rated items generally correlated with higher revenue

## Data Cleaning & Preparation (Excel)

Removed duplicate records
Checked and handled missing values
Standardized text fields (Outlet types, etc.)
Created calculated fields (Example Total Sales = Qty Ã— Price)
Formatted columns for consistency (dates, currency etc.)
Built Pivot Tables for slicing and also aggregation
Linked visuals with slicers to make it more interactive and easier to breakdown.

## Tools Used.

This project was done entirely using Microsoft Excel (from Data Cleaning to Dashboard Building.)

## Recommendations

- Increase promotion for top-selling categories inorder to maximize revenue.
- Improve visibility and marketing for low-performing products.
- Extend Supermarket Type 1 format to other types, as it delivers the highest sales.
- Focus on quality assurance, since better-rated products sell more.
- Use visibility strategies (end-caps, eye-level placement) to drive sales further.
